			<p>The entrance, a little door wedged between a storefront and the end of the building, lies under the trestle of the M and J trains, and is marked by a small painted sign. Inside, a stairway leads up to the gym, which consists of two rooms full of weights, one on the second floor and one on the third.</p>

			<p>I found the manager behind a desk on the third floor, a small, grizzled man with a white beard.</p>

			<p>“I’m interested in a membership,” I said.</p>

			<p>“What you see is what you get,” he answered.</p>

			<p>What I saw was a dark room with Victorian moulding and old ceiling fans weakly turning. There were maybe a dozen people there, from a mix of ethnicities — latinos, blacks, anglos, and Hasidic Jews with curling locks hanging over their ears. A row of windows at the front opened on the elevated train tracks.</p>

			<p>“Do you have showers?”</p>

			<p>“They don’t work. The landlord don’t want to fix them. And I notice you’re wiping your forehead. There’s no air conditioning; it gets to a hundred or more in here.”</p>

			<p>“You’re a hell of a salesman.”</p>

			<p>He shrugged. “I don’t want you complaining in August.”</p>

			<p>Reverse psychology must work on me, because I paid the $30 for a month. I went back in the evening in my gym clothes; he was still there.</p>

			<p>“Where did you say you live?” he asked. I told him the nearest intersection, and he nodded his head toward a tall young man and said: “He lives there.” I squinted at the young man and said I didn’t recognize him.</p>

			<p>It occurred to me then that the grizzled old man, who showed little evidence of being a businessman, might see himself as a different kind of pillar of the community: the elder, whose talent for connecting people is not quite obviated by craigslist.</p>

			<p>And the gym is an excellent place for such connections. I have reflected before that I have met a disproportionate number of friends at the gym, though I am not a gym rat. In college, for instance, it was not unusual for someone to come up to me as I was working out and say, “Hey, you’re in my chemistry class,” leading to a mysterious bond of allegiance.</p>

			<p>For the most part, however, these seem to be male friends. I once went on a date with a girl I met at the gym, but I think I’d just as easily have struck up a conversation with her on the bus: the sense of allegiance didn’t apply.</p>

			<p>I recently read somewhere the claim that men bond by doing activities together (such as spotting each other on benchpresses), while women bond verbally. It is doubtless more complicated than that, but I suspect there is some truth to the claim. There was a long-term case study of a group of highly gifted children (back in the day when people were fascinated by such things), and one conclusion of the study struck me: high verbal intelligence was somewhat correlated with poor social adaptation, but especially so for girls. Whatever one thinks about the validity of measures of verbal intelligence, the fact that variation of that particular factor should have more of an impact on girls than on boys suggests that verbal communication is more socially important for girls than for boys.</p>

			<p>In contrast to the ease of making friends at the gym, it is very difficult to make friends in a ballet class (where the students are mostly women), and perhaps the lack of verbal communication helps explain why. I attended a weekly ballet-for-beginners class in Philly for a while. The owner of the dance academy, a gregarious woman with the muscular legs of a dancer and short, jet black hair, stopped what she was doing the second time I came to class and studied me for a moment. A smile broke out across her face, and she said, “You’re here because you know where the girls are!” She laughed a little every time she saw me after that.</p>

			<p>But of course no bond of allegiance arises in such a context. Worse, the students came irregularly, and one would have had to be aggressive and fast to get anywhere with any of them. I think I joined a book club after that. The book club lasted until it became apparent that they only read potboilers.</p>

			<p>After I’d done squats and bench presses at Frenchie’s, and the sweat was pouring off of me, I went to the old man at the desk to buy a gatorade from him.</p>

			<p>“Tired already?!” he said. “How you going to be a champion?”</p>

			<p>“I’m not done yet,” I said.</p>
