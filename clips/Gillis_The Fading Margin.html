		<h1>Synopsis of <em>The Fading Margin</em>, a novel of roughly 97,000 words</h1>

		<div class="row">

				<p>The Fading Margin examines the lives of its two protagonists from multiple perspectives, searching for the sources of the differences in their characters and life outcomes. The above excerpt, the beginning of the novel, is the readerâ€™s first encounter with the characters. The next chapter shows them roughly thirty years later, when their lives have diverged dramatically and perhaps surprisingly. The rest of the novel looks at segments of their lives in childhood, young adulthood, and later to try to explain the divergence.</p>
				<p>One of the characters is driven by a need for self-understanding to dream of inventing a time machine, and eventually he escapes the world of work to join a commune for thinkers and tinkerers in southern Colorado where he can pursue the invention. His friend meanwhile slowly builds a career in New York while studying the successes and failures of people around him. </p>

				It is the death of one of these people that brings the novel to its culmination. The friend in New York returns home to Boulder, Colorado for the funeral of a charismatic uncle, and he meets the other friend there. It is a moment of finality, when the arcs of their lives seem if not inevitable, at least irreversible.
