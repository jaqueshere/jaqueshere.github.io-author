				<h2>Tarrytown, Arkansas 1965</h2>
				<p></p>
				<p>Gray flits through the gray grass and disappears in a hole. The moon reflects in a second story window for a moment, but a change in the wind lets the tall darkness of trees obscure it. Toby puts a hand on a fence post, still sturdy though the paint's all weathered away. In the other hand he holds a big brown shoe. He hops over, then looks back at Becky. In the moonlight, the blood on her neck and arms is black, and the stitches painted on her face look more real than the rest of her.</p>

				<p>“My heels...”</p>
				<p>“I'd have thought a zombie wouldn't need heels.”</p>
				<p>“Hold them.”</p>
				<p>She slips her shoes off and hands them over the fence. </p>
				<p>There is dim light from the windows of the first floor, and occasional shouts and bursts of laughter. </p>
				<p>Toby is seventeen. Heaven and hell might exist. But the candles inside are certain, and Becky is certain.</p>

				<p>He holds one of Becky's hands while with the other she slips her heels back on. He sees through tall grass the glint of the chrome grill of Jerry's Chrysler, kudzu reaching down toward the car's open cab. There is movement behind the windshield. Jerry and Mike sharing a 40, or Jerry and a girl necking. It is insubstantial but still vaguely threatening.</p>
				<p>“What is the story about this place?” Toby asks, looking away from the car.</p>

				<p>“It belongs to the Bennet family, and they lived here until about twenty years ago. That's when Hannah Bennet got engaged to be married. Dwight something or other, her groom-to-be, loved her so much that he would send her a note every day, even if they had talked on the phone—even if they had gone out together. She would always get a note.”</p>
				<p>She takes his arm, and they start across the lawn.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4">
				<p>“One day he was coming to see her with a nice bunch of roses, but she was in the bath, and when she heard him talking to the maid, she got up and knocked a radio into the bath water. She died instantly.”</p>
				<p>There is an open hole in the back porch where a floorboard had been, but the remaining floorboards are stable. Toby holds Becky's hand as they approach the back door. </p>
				<p>“When he saw what had happened, he ate a box of rat poison he found in the maid's quarters. Died right there. They say their ghosts keep trying to find each other here, but can't.”</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4">
				<p>From inside the mansion, there is now the sound of someone tentatively strumming a guitar, trying out his voice with the first bar of a song.</p>
				<p>“Sounds like the maid did it, to me,” Toby says.</p>
				<p>“They could still be looking for each other,” she says.</p>
				<p>A dank smell is on the other side of the door. Broken bits of stucco are all about the floor, crunching under feet. A door frame is visible by candlelight from another room. They go to it.</p>
			</div>

				<p>In the other room, people crouch against the wall passing around a bottle. Several candles sit in the necks of beer bottles or in mason jars in the center of the room, illuminating collapsed plaster on the floor, a chair leg, an old broken television, a glistening stream of water down one wall. He gives Becky's hand a squeeze.</p>
				<p>“What are you supposed to be?” Abe asks him. Toby goes to the broken TV and pounds on it with the heel of the shoe.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4">
				<p>“We will bury you!” he grumbles, realizing that he should have shouted.</p>
				<p>“Ha ha!”</p>
				<p>“Hitler?”</p>
				<p>“Shut up and pass the bourbon.”</p>
				<p>Toby and Becky sit and take shots from the cheap bourbon that's going around. Someone tosses him a beer. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4">
				<p>Toby has seen most of these kids at school. Some of them he knows by name, though he doesn't see any real friends. Joe said he'd be here. </p>
				<p>Soon, he and Becky have left the group to explore. Becky holds Toby's Zippo lighter up, wadded in a bit of sleeve so it won't scald her, and he carries the remaining three of a six pack of beers in one hand, the fingers of his other hand tucked into the waist of her skirt. </p>
				<p>They find a flight of stairs and slowly climb it. At the top, three large windows filled with moonlight and blackness of trees loom up over the banister. A large room with scattered chairs opens before them. In the middle is a grand piano, clearly visible in the moonlight. It is covered with some kind of powder. </p>

				<p>“Oh my God!” Toby whispers. “Play it, Becky.”</p>
				<p>“Play it? What do you want me to play?”</p>
				<p>“Play some of that Bach you were playing before.”</p>
				<p>She pulls out the bench and lifts the cover from the keyboard. </p>
				<p>“Here.” He throws his Khrushchev jacket over the piano bench so she can sit.</p>
				<p>She plays. The notes don't sound right, but still Bach is recognizable. </p>
				<p>He stands behind her and runs his fingers along her neck. The night before, as he fell asleep and disconnected images rose from somewhere, he saw her smiling at him. It was a smile of total redemption, of affirmation, of lasting love.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4">
				<p>A car door closes, and another, and Toby is tense. Jerry might come up and turn this scene of approaching redemption and love into a scene of loud bragging and possibly fighting.</p>
				<p>But there are no steps on the stairs or in the hall below. </p>
				<p>Many years later, he will tell himself that he did not love her. He will tell himself that he was in love with the innocence they shared, which was not Christian innocence, but something better. He will tell himself that neither of them was really innocent, neither of them had the innocence he imagined, so it was love of an illusion. He will tell himself these things for decades.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4">
				<p>But for now he feels her sensitive flesh under his fingers and hears her sensitive playing; the scene is organized by her intelligence, and he knows that his every motion communicates to her. Her hands leave the keys as his run down her spine. He is sitting next to her now and now she is sliding off her skirt and he cradles her head in his hand as she leans back onto the piano bench. She is everything; yet Toby will remember later how the trees swelled against the window in the wind.</p>
				<p>They stay up there a long time. They hear voices below the window, the doors of Jerry's Chrysler open and voices, and the doors close, and the Chrysler engine starts and roars out over damp grass and whatever lives in there. </p>
				<p>They drink the beers that Toby brought up and write words on each other with their fingers. Toby begins to feel drunk, and when they do it again he gets semen all over her. He is filled with remorse, but she smiles, and the remorse vanishes, leaving a feeling of deep peace. </p>

				<p>Toby bangs his shin against something on their way down, and he limps across the lawn by Becky's side. He considered dozing in the car for a while before driving Becky home to clear his head, but the pain of his bruised shin clears his head. </p>
				<p>The road winds through old woods, a winding of stars showing through the tall old wood above. Becky rests her head on his shoulder. She puts her hand between his legs, and he is delighted to realize that he is getting another erection. But she removes her hand, seeming to forget what she was doing, and leans against the door. </p>
				<p>He looks over at her, and though her eyes are still open, it looks as though she may fall asleep any moment.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4">
				<p>He veers off toward the line of trees, fast speeding into one. She bolts upright and grabs his arm. Just before his own stomach turns, he turns the car back.</p>
				<p>“Oh my lord, you scared me,” she says, and slumps back. He chuckles.</p>
				<p>Then he does it again. She bolts upright and grabs his arm, no less than the first time.</p>
				<p>“Oh, Toby, come on.”</p>
				<p>He waits for a minute. She slumps back against the door. Then he does it again.</p>
				<p>This time the trees come a little fast, and it takes him a minute to understand where he is when he wakes up with the steering wheel pressed into his left shoulder, bits of the windshield on his face and in his hair, and a piece of the dashboard jabbing his right arm.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4">
				<p>It is dark. He cannot see anything. He starts to cry. He doesn't know why, but hot tears run down his cheeks and he shakes with sobs. He waits for Becky to say something, not daring to reach over to touch her. His sobbing is the only sound. There is no one to comfort him, no one to smile at him and fill him with peace. He is completely alone.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>Five years later, he is a rather old sophomore at UC Berkeley. He will later thumb rumpled photographs of himself from this time with his many friends. He is sitting on the grass with two other sophomores. He will later write them into poems that seem easy to understand, but they really aren't. </p>
